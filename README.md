NodeBoiler
==========
This is an early version of a Boilerplate I've set up for myself to quickly start new Node projects. Feel free to use it, but on your own risk as it's not thouroughly tested yet :)

The goal of the project is to have an initial Boilerplate/Framework using these technologies:
 * A Node.js server running Express
 * A Node.js server running Socket.IO
 * A front-end using Backbone as MVC base
 * MongoDb with Mongoose for data access and client sync through Socket.IO to Backbone
